# PDR v4.0 Implementation Progress

## Pre-Flight Status
✓ Working tree clean
✓ `just check` passes (all 26 packages)
✓ Schema tables exist: task_metrics, task_context
✓ SetParentTask method exists
✓ Bus event publishing works
✓ Delegation tool uses polling
✗ Coordinator package doesn't exist yet (will create in Phase 2)

## Phase 1: Wire the Foundation
✓ PASSED - Commit: f8dbec4

**Changes:**
- Added SetTaskContext, GetTaskContext, GetAllTaskContext methods
- Added comprehensive tests for task context isolation
- Wired parent_task_id into delegation (SetParentTask after task creation)
- Added capability-based routing parameter to DelegateTaskInput
- Supports either target_agent (specific) OR capability (routed)
- Updated delegation input validation and test

**Gate 1 Verification:**
- ✓ just check: All 26 packages pass
- ✓ go test -race ./...: All tests pass
- ✓ Context store methods exist and tested
- ✓ parent_task_id wired into delegation
- ✓ Capability routing parameter added

## Phase 2: Event-Driven Completion Tracking
✓ PASSED - Commit: (pending)

**Changes:**
- Created internal/coordinator/waiter.go with TaskCompletionWaiter
- Implemented WaitForTask (single task with polling)
- Implemented WaitForAll (parallel multi-task waiter)
- Added TaskResult struct with full result tracking
- Refactored delegate_task to use Waiter instead of inline polling
- Updated delegation to handle context cancellation gracefully
- Added test helpers in waiter_test.go (timeout and construction tests)

**Gate 2 Verification:**
- ✓ just check: All 28 packages pass
- ✓ go test -race ./...: All tests pass (no race conditions)
- ✓ go test ./internal/coordinator/: All tests pass
- ✓ WaitForTask exists at line 42
- ✓ WaitForAll exists at line 79
- ✓ grep -c "time.Sleep" internal/tools/delegate.go = 0 (polling removed)

## Phase 3: Working DAG Executor
✓ PASSED - Commit: (pending)

**Changes:**
- Created internal/coordinator/plan.go with Plan, PlanStep, StepResult, ExecutionResult types
- Created internal/coordinator/executor.go with Executor and task orchestration
- Implemented Execute method that handles plan validation and wave execution
- Implemented executeWave for parallel step execution with real completion tracking
- Implemented resolvePrompt for template substitution ({step.output} references)
- Implemented topoSort for topological sorting with cycle detection
- Added Plan.Validate for plan integrity checks
- Added PlanExecution stub methods to persistence/store.go
- Created comprehensive executor_test.go with 11 test cases

**Gate 3 Verification:**
- ✓ just check: All 28 packages pass
- ✓ go test ./internal/coordinator/ -v: All tests pass (11 executor + 2 waiter tests)
- ✓ WaitForAll usage at line 119 in executor.go
- ✓ resolvePrompt at lines 92, 141-142 in executor.go
- ✓ CreatePlanExecution/CompletePlanExecution calls at lines 48, 59, 70, 78 in executor.go

## Phase 4: Plan System
✓ PASSED - Commit: (pending)

**Completed Steps:**
- Step 4.1: Added Plans to Config schema (PlanConfig, PlanStepConfig types) ✓
- Step 4.2: Created internal/coordinator/loader.go with LoadPlansFromConfig function ✓
- Step 4.3: Added comprehensive loader tests (4 test cases) ✓
- Step 4.4: Added /plan command to TUI command handler ✓
- Step 4.5: Added plans field reference to gateway.go for future API work ✓
- Step 4.6: Verified config.yaml with plans section loads without error ✓

**Gate 4 Verification:**
- ✓ just check: All 28 packages pass
- ✓ go test ./... -race: All tests pass
- ✓ go test ./internal/coordinator/ -v: All tests pass (19 tests)
- ✓ PlanConfig found at line 165 in config.go
- ✓ Plans field found at line 165 in config.go
- ✓ LoadPlansFromConfig found at line 11 in loader.go
- ✓ /plan command found at line 168 in tui/chat.go
- ✓ plans reference found at line 85 in gateway.go
- ✓ Config with plans parses successfully

## Phase 5: TUI Visibility
✓ PASSED - Commit: (pending)

**Completed Steps:**
- Step 5.1: Added delegationStatus and activeDelegation types to TUI
- Step 5.2: Added planStepStatus and activePlan types to TUI
- Step 5.3: Added delegation event publishing to delegate.go (delegation.started/completed)
- Step 5.4: Added plan event publishing to executor.go (plan.step.started/completed)
- Step 5.5: Added /plan command to TUI help and handler

**Gate 5 Verification:**
- ✓ just check: All 28 packages pass
- ✓ go test ./... -race: All tests pass
- ✓ go build ./internal/tui/: Successful
- ✓ delegation.started found at line 163 in delegate.go
- ✓ delegation.completed found at line 169 in delegate.go

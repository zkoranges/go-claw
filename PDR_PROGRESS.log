PDR Implementation Progress - started 2026-02-14
================================================

Pre-flight: ✓ All tests pass, build clean

PHASE 1: Data Foundation
Status: IN PROGRESS
PHASE 1: ✓ PASSED
  Step 1.2: Added schema V9 constants
  Step 1.3: Added parent_task_id column to tasks
  Step 1.4: Added prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, total_tokens, estimated_cost_usd columns  
  Step 1.5: Created observability tables (task_metrics, agent_activity_log, agent_collaboration_metrics, task_context)
  Step 1.6: Created pricing engine
  Step 1.7: Added UpdateTaskTokens method
  Step 1.8: Added RecordTaskMetrics and SetParentTask methods
  Step 1.9: Wired RecordTaskMetrics into CompleteTask and FailTask
  GATE 1: ✓ all checks passed

PHASE 2: Event Infrastructure
Status: ✓ PASSED
  Step 2.1: Identified bus and store wiring points
  Step 2.2: Added bus field to Store struct
  Step 2.3: Updated Store.Open() to accept eventBus parameter
  Step 2.4: Updated main.go, skill.go, doctor.go
  Step 2.5: Fixed all 18 test files to pass eventBus (nil) parameter
  GATE 2: ✓ all checks passed (build + vet + test + race)

PHASE 3: Event Publishing from State Changes
Status: ✓ PASSED
  Step 3.1: Implemented event publishing in task completion paths
  Step 3.2: Implemented event publishing in task failure/cancellation paths
  Step 3.3: Added event payload types (TaskStateChangedEvent, TaskMetricsEvent, etc.)
  Step 3.4: Updated CompleteTask, FailTask, AbortTask, UpdateTaskTokens, RecordTaskMetrics
  GATE 3: ✓ all checks passed (build + vet + test + race)

PHASE 4: Team Workflows / Plan Execution
Status: ✓ PASSED
  Step 4.1: Added schema v10 (team_plans, team_plan_steps tables)
  Step 4.2: Implemented CreateTeamPlan, ListTeamPlansBySession methods
  Step 4.3: Implemented GetTeamPlanSteps for plan execution
  Step 4.4: Added execution_strategy support (sequential/parallel/round_robin)
  Step 4.5: Added TeamPlan and TeamPlanStep structs with full schema
  GATE 4: ✓ all checks passed (build + vet + test + race)

PHASE 5: Experiments & Analytics
Status: ✓ PASSED
  Step 5.1: Added schema v11 (experiments, experiment_samples tables)
  Step 5.2: Implemented CreateExperiment method
  Step 5.3: Implemented RecordExperimentSample for outcome tracking
  Step 5.4: Implemented ListExperimentsBySession and GetExperimentSamples
  Step 5.5: Added Experiment and ExperimentSample structs with full schema
  GATE 5: ✓ all checks passed (build + vet + test + race)
